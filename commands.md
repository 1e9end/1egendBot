## Documentation
Still need help? Join [Akira Discord Support Server](https://discord.gg/DAaRAHWw9W) for manual support.


Note that the documentation uses the default prefix `$` for examples. Replace `$` with your server prefix for Akira if you have changed it. <br/>
**The command names are NOT case sensitive, i.e $HeLp works the same as $help**
