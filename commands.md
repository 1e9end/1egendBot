## Documentation

Note that the documentation uses the default prefix `$` for examples. <br/>
If you have changed the prefix on the bot, replace `$` with whatever your prefix is.

**The command names are NOT case sensitive, i.e $HeLp works the same as $help**

## Commands
- $help [command_name]: Shows info about [command_name]. If [command_name] is omitted (i.e just $help), shows the Help Menu
- $hello: Replies with a randomly chosen warm greeting ðŸ¤Ž
- $prefix [new_prefix]: Changes the prefix to [new_prefix]. <br/>
**[new_prefix] can only be chosen from the list: `!, $, %, ^, &, *, ?, ;, ~, +, -, =, >, <`**
